cannot get packer to generate hepltags

I am using the latest commit on macos, and I am using doom-nvim (fyi..)



  it seems that some plugins under `start/` does have tags generated, so
  there is a handful of plugins that are browseable.

  packer does not show tags under `docs/` .

  i have updated neovim, and followed the instructions under #133.

  still tags don't seem to be generated.
