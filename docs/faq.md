## General

### What type of vimmer is Doom Nvim intended for?

Doom Nvim is intended for all types of Vimmer who want a stable and efficient
development environment without spending a lot of time setting everything up.

### Why does Doom Nvim only support Neovim 0.5+?

Doom Nvim doesn't support Neovim versions lower than the current stable (0.5) due to:

- some features would be lost
- Not all Lua plugins have good alternatives in Vimscript, so the experience
  would not be the same
- performance would not be the same as Lua cannot be used
