i need to fix the startup errs below so that vim can start working again in the browser so that you don't need to use it at all.


```vim
[doom] [WARN  08:02:04] [string "..."]:0: doom-treesitter:  clang has poor compatibility compiling treesitter parsers.  We recommend using gcc, see issue #246 for details.  (https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim/issues/246)
```
